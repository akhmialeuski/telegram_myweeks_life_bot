"""Telegram bot that tracks and reports the number of weeks lived since birth.

This script implements a Telegram bot that:
- Calculates the number of weeks lived since a specified birth date
- Responds to /weeks command with the current count
- Sends weekly notifications on Mondays
- Provides monthly statistics
- Generates visual representation of weeks lived in a grid format
  - Each cell represents one week
  - Each row represents one year (52 weeks)
  - Green cells show weeks lived
  - Empty cells show weeks to come
  - Years and weeks are labeled on axes
  - Includes a legend for easy interpretation

:requires: Environment variables:
    - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: The Telegram bot API token
    - DATE_OF_BIRTH: Birth date in YYYY-MM-DD format
    - CHAT_ID: The Telegram chat ID for notifications

:example: To run the bot, ensure all environment variables are set in .env file and execute:
    python myweeks_life_bot.py

:note: This version is compatible with Python 3.13 and python-telegram-bot v20+ (async API).
